To replicate conda environment:
1. Pull the environment.yml file.
2. In terminal, run 'conda env create -f environment.yml'.
3. Type 'conda activate azure_tables' to switch to the new environment.

'environment.yml' is preferred over 'requirements.txt', but you may also load a conda environment from 'requirements.txt'.
